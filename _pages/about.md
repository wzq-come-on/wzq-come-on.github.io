I am a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Information Science and Technology, Dalian Maritime University (211), majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a GPA of 3.91/5 (average score: 89.1).

I am very fortunate to be advised by Assoc. Prof. Qian Ma from the School of Information Science and Technology, DMU.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Data Mining, and Deep Learning, with a focus on multivariate time series imputation and intelligent agent system development.

### Research Projects
- **AttnWGAIN: Attention-Based Imputation Network** (2023.03–2025.07)  
   - Role: First Author  
   - Core Contributions: Proposed the AttnWGAIN model (WGAN+Transformer structure) and joint training task MIT+ORT for IoT multivariate time series missing data imputation; Achieved 5%–26% MAE reduction, 3%–33% RMSE reduction, and over 15% MRE reduction on four real-world datasets; Models trained on imputed data performed excellently in downstream classification tasks.  
   - Outcomes: TCE (CCF-B) accepted; One invention patent under substantive examination.

- **TimeMultiformer: Attention-Based Collaborative Feature Learning** (2025.01–2025.06)  
   - Role: First Author  
   - Core Contributions: Developed TimeMultiformer for multivariate time series imputation; Introduced time-lag matrix and diagonal masked multi-head attention; Combined Transformer and iTransformer to capture spatio-temporal dependencies; Reduced MAE by 2%–16%, RMSE by 10%–26%, MRE by over 10% on four real datasets; Improved ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores in downstream tasks compared to SOTA models.  
   - Outcomes: WAIM (CCF-C) accepted.

- **STIMim: Missing Structure-Aware Time-Series Imputation** (2024.10–Present)  
   - Role: Second Author  
   - Core Contributions: Proposed STIMim framework for structured missing problems in multivariate time series; Integrated VMPM mask distribution alignment mechanism to alleviate training-test distribution shift; Combined iTransformer and Mamba for cross-variable correlation modeling and long-range dependency recovery; Achieved 25.5%/25.0%/26.0% improvement in MAE/RMSE/MRE under random missing conditions, and 15.5%/6.5%/15.2% under structured missing conditions on three real datasets.  
   - Outcomes: Paper under submission to ICDE (CCF-A).

### Internship Experience
- **Algorithm Intern**, Neusoft Corporation (Commercial Software Division) (2025.10–Present)  
  - Participated in the R&D of an Agent Loop-based automated mobile phone recovery system, responsible for the visual perception and information retrieval subsystem.  
  - Designed and implemented an Adaptive RAG dynamic retrieval module, improving planning stability and decision accuracy of complex recovery processes by over 20%.  
  - Built a high-precision screen element recognition pipeline using YOLOv8 + EasyOCR; Encapsulated visual capabilities into reusable "Vision Tools" for Agent Loop calling.  
  - Constructed abnormal recovery and failure retry logic, realizing Agent’s multi-round closed-loop "observation-reasoning-execution" process.
